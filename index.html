          <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js. JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses.</p> 
            <p>JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
          
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li> <!--- Without <ul> or <ol> it will appear as a bulleted list, recommended if you are not using too many bullets or points --->
          <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
          <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.</li>

        <article>
          <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
          <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
          <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
          <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>

          <header>Executing Your First "Hello World!"</header>
          <p>JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
<p>However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic JavaScript to your page, creating a "hello world!" example.</p>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
          <code>
            <!--- element defines a fragment of computer code. --->function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello" + yourName);
            }
            
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

              <article>
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change.</p>
                <p>if we didn't have variables available, we'd have to implement a giant code block that checked what the entered name was, and then display the appropriate message for that name. This is obviously really inefficient (the code is a lot bigger, even for only five choices), and it just wouldn't work — you couldn't possibly store all possible choices.</p>
                <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
                <p>Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.</p>

        <article>
          <header>Declaring Variables</header>
          <p>To use a variable you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword var followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
          <code>
            var myName;
            var myAge;
          </code>
          <p>Here we're creating two variables called <kbd>myName</kbd> and <kbd>myAge</kbd>. Try typing these lines in now in your web browser's console, or in the below console (You can open this console in a separate tab or window if you'd prefer that). After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.
            <p>You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable's name, e.g.</p>
          <code>
            myName;
            myAge;
          </code>
          <p>They currently have no value; they are empty containers. When you enter the variable names, you should get a value of <kbd>undefined</kbd> returned. If they don't exist, you'll get an error message — try typing in:</p>
          <code>
            scoopityPoop;
          </code>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="functions">
        <article>
          <header>Functions</header>
          <p>The custom function we are going to build will be called displayMessage(). It will display a custom message box on a web page and will act as a customized replacement for a browser's built-in alert() function. We've seen this before, but let's just refresh our memories. Type the following in your browser's JavaScript console, on any page you like:</p>
          <code>
            alert('This is a message');
          </code>
          <p>The <kbd>alert</kbd> function takes a single argument — the string that is displayed in the alert box. Try varying the string to change the message.

            The <kbd>alert</kbd> function is limited: you can alter the message, but you can't easily vary anything else, such as the color, icon, or anything else.</p>

          <header>Looping Code</header>
              <p>Loops, loops, loops. As well as being associated with popular breakfast cereals, roller coasters and musical production, they are also a critical concept in programming. Programming loops are all to do with doing the same thing over and over again — which is termed iteration in programming speak.</p>
          <p>Let's start exploring some specific loop constructs. The first, which you'll use most of the time, is the for loop — this has the following syntax:</p>
          <code>
            for (initializer; exit-condition; final-expression) {
            // code to run
            }
          </code>
          <p>Here we have:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.</li>
            <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semi-colons:</li>
            <ol> 
              <li>An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.</li>
              <li>An exit-condition — as mentioned before, this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.</li>
            <li>A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the exit condition value.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.</li>
            <p>Let's look at a real example so we can visualize what these do more clearly.
            <code>
              var cats = ['Bill', 'Jeff', 'Pete', 'Biggles', 'Jasmin'];
              var info = 'My cats are called ';
              var para = document.querySelector('p');

              for (var i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
               info += cats[i] + ', ';
              }

              para.textContent = info;
            </code>
              <p>This gives us the following output:</p>
              <code>
                My cats are called Bill, Jeff, Pete, Biggles, Jasmin,
              </code>
              <p>This shows a loop being used to iterate over the items in an array and do something with each of them — a very common pattern in JavaScript. Here:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The iterator, i, starts at <kbd>0 (var i = 0)</kbd>.</li>
                <li>It has been told to run until it is no longer smaller than the length of the cats array. This is important — the exit condition shows the condition under which the loop will still run. So in this case, while i <kbd> cats.length</kbd> is still true, the loop will still run.</li>
                <li>Inside the loop, we concatenate the current loop item <kbd>(cats[i]</kbd> is <kbd>cats[whatever i is at the time])</kbd> along with a comma and a space, onto the end of the info variable. So:
                  <ol>
                    <li>During the first run, <kbd>i = 0, so cats[0] + ', '</kbd> will be concatenated onto info ("Bill, ").</li>
                    <li>During the second run, <kbd>i = 1</kbd>, so <kbd>cats[1] + ', '</kbd> will be concatenated onto info ("Jeff, ")</li>
                    <li>And so on. After each time the loop has run, 1 will be added to <kbd>i (i++)</kbd>, then the process will start again.</li>
                  </ol>
                <li>When <kbd>i</kbd> becomes equal to <kbd>cats.length</kbd>, the loop will stop, and the browser will move on to the next bit of code below the loop.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One small problem we are left with is that the final output sentence isn't very well-formed:</p>
            <code>
              My cats are called Bill, Jeff, Pete, Biggles, Jasmin,
            </code>
            <p>Ideally we want to change the concatenation on the final loop iteration so that we haven't got a comma on the end of the sentence. Well, no problem — we can quite happily insert a conditional inside our for loop to handle this special case:</p>
            <code>
              for (var i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
              if (i === cats.length - 1) {
                info += 'and ' + cats[i] + '.';
               } else {
                  info += cats[i] + ', ';
               }
              }                             
              </code>

              <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types</p>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                <li>and Object</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
